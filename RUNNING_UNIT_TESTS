== Creating the test database

The default names for the test databases are "activerecord_unittest" and 
"activerecord_unittest2". If you want to use another database name then be sure 
to update the connection adapter setups you want to test with in 
test/connections/<your database>/connection.rb. Define a user named 'rails' 
in SQL Server with all privileges granted for the test databases. Use an empty 
password for said user.

The connection files make certain assumptions. For instance, the ODBC connection 
assumes you have a DSN setup that matches the name of the default database names.
Review the test/connections/native_sqlserver_#{mode} file you are testing for details.


== Requirements

Get the development dependencies.

  $ bundle install

The tests of this adapter depend on the existence of rails checkout. Make sure 
to checkout remotes/origin/2-3-stable, I suggest using the git_remote_branch to 
create a personal tracking branch. Then make a local topic branch off of that like
2-3-stable_sqlserver and commit this patch https://gist.github.com/761508 or you 
will have around 90 some errors like this.
